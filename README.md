## Projects

Note: Some projects are only listed on my [webpage](https://edmond120.github.io).

### Mutant, a configuration file manager
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/mutant)

Language: Python, M4 (The language used for GNU Autotools)

This project uses dependency resolution to generate configuration
files for multiple computers from the same set of templates.
By locking behind features based dependencies and allowing configuration
files to provide dependencies based on certain conditions, the program
can determine all the features that can be enabled on a system without
causing any issues.

### Simple machine language emulator
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/simple_machine_language_emulator)

Language: Python

This is an emulator that runs a simplified machine language for
educational purposes.
It has basic graphics capabilities through a memory mapping API.

### Discord bot
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/discord_bot)

Language: JavaScript

This is a chat bot used to remember and reference messages on Discord.

### Brooklyn College Graph Theory Research Utilities

These are some utilities that I wrote to aid in graph theory research
during my time in college.

#### Graph Profiler
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/graph_profiler)

Language: C

A tool to filter graphs that was used to aid the study of graph
counting algorithms.

#### Graph Theory Scripts
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/graph_scripts)

Languages: Python, Bash

A collection of scripts used to process graphs and do compile data
based on their degree sequences.

### Stuyvesant High School Projects

My high school projects.

#### 3D Graphics Engine
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/graphics_engine_remake)

Languages: Python

A Python graphics engine that draws 3D objects by reading from a script file.
It can draw lines, circles, hermite curves, bezier curves, boxes, spheres, and tori.
In addition, it also comes with matrix transformations such as translate, scale, and rotate.

#### Processing Game
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/game)

Languages: Java

This is a top down shooter video game that I made with
[Processing](https://processing.org/), a Java graphics framework.

What is interesting about this project, is that it includes
a keyboard controllable worm. The worm is made of multiple segments
and you can steer its head, the rest of the segments are controlled
by game physics making it possible to swing the tail around when
turning.

#### Botto
[Repository](https://github.com/Edmond120/finalProject)

Languages: Java

A framework to build chatbots not with APIs but rather by interacting
with the browser through [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/).
